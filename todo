Store NFT Metadata on Ceramic Streams instead of Pinata
Have another stream to do the token_id:stream_id mapping (lookup table)
Another stream to keep track of the unissued token_ids? -> CHECK if ERC721 has a function to check if a token_id has a current owner

Pick an unissued token_id at random and send that URI for the mint

When verified, use token_id to find that nft's stream_id and then increase the counter

// Todo

- update stream creation script (createModel.mjs) for nft metadata, token:stream mapping
- update nft issuance logic to account for Ceramic and unissued token_ids
  OR just issue in a linear fashion
- increment counter of "times done" when verified
- see friend's completed activities on Ceramic
- move everything to truffle
- host front end on arweave
- update readme

5/28

- DONE inside getAllNFTs() make sure that token ids are being used to get streams of owned NFTs
- increment times done when verified
- check caip-10 linkages for finding friends and seeing what they've done and verified
- cleanup ceramic streams and issue new ones
